                        Welcome to my personal website! My name is Timothy Small (Smalls). I am an IT professional with
                        many years of experience both professionally and personally. This website will showcase all of
                        my work and more. You will find information about myself, projects I am working on or have
                        worked on, pictures I have taken, and more. I also have a separate blog where I ramble on about
                        what I'm working on and my interests.
